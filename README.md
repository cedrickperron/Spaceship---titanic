# Spaceship---titanic
This is the Kaggle competition: spaceship - titanic. We provide various machine learning solutions - both classical and quantum - to this problem.

## Packages
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn pennylane torch


### Models
We train multiple models:
- Random Forest
- kNN
- Logistic Regression
- Classical Neural Networks
- Quantum Neural Network with Matrix Product State (MPS) Tensor Network
- Quantum Neural Network with Strongly Entangling Layers
